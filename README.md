# 18-Workout-Tracker

## Description

Web App that tracks and saves your workouts and the details from those workouts including exercise data.

## Installation

Nothing to install, simply visit my deployed site here : [Workout Tracker](https://safe-waters-47347.herokuapp.com/)

## Usage

At the homepage you will see your last workout pulled from the database. If you would like to continue with that workout, select "continue workout". If you would like to start new, select "New Workout". Both take you to the add new exercise screen. Choose the type from the dropdown menu, and fill out the required data about your exercise. Select "add exercise" and either repeat the previous steps, or choose "complete workout" to save your data. To view aggregated data, click the "dashboard" link at the top menu.
